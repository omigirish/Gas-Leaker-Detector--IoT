# IoT- Gas Leak Detector 

As a part of this IoT project I have created :

1. A cheap gas detector that can detect leakage before it crosses hazardous level. 
2. Make it simple, portable and battery operated.
3. The Internet of Things will come into picture to make autonomous alert possible even when the user is not at home.
4. The gas sensor is highly flexible and can be calibrated to detect any particular gas. However it is designed to detect household gas leaks.

This simple device finds it application even in the industries especially chemical plants and factories.

For detailed Literature of this project please refer to the this [documentation]().

**Note:** This project is built on **Arduino Node MCU** to use it on other IoT boards a few changes will be needed.
